# Chapter 01 - Exercises


1. What happens when you add 0 to the values NaN , Infinity , false , true , null ,
   and undefined ? What happens when you concatenate the empty string with
   NaN , Infinity , false , true , null , and undefined ? Guess first and then try it out.

2. What are [] + [] , {} + [] , [] + {} , {} + {} , [] - {} ? Compare the results of
   evaluating the expressions at the command line and assigning them to a
   variable. Explain your findings.

3. As in Java and C++ (and unlike Python which follows many centuries of
   mathematical experience), n % 2 is -1 if n is a negative integer. Explore the
   behavior of the % operator for negative operands. Analyze integers and
   floating-point numbers.

4. Suppose angle is some angle in degrees that, after adding or subtracting
   other angles, has assumed an arbitrary value. You want to normalize it
   so that it is between 0 (inclusive) and 360 (exclusive). How do you do
   that with the % operator?

5. List as many different ways as you can to produce the string with two
   backslash characters \\ in JavaScript, using the mechanisms described in
   this chapter.

6. List as many different ways as you can to produce the string with the
   single character üåê in JavaScript.

7. Give a realistic example in which a template string has an embedded 
   expression that contains another template string with an embedded
   expression.

8. Give three ways of producing an array with a "hole" in the index sequence.

9. Declare an array with elements at index positions 0,  0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 .

10. What happens when an array of arrays is converted to a string?

11. Make a couple of objects representing people and store them in variables
    harry and sally . To each person, add a property friends that contains an
    array with their best friends. Suppose harry is a friend of sally and sally
    is a friend of harry . What happens when you log each object? What
    happens when you call JSON.stringify ?
